# Data Professional Survey Analysis Project

# Overview

This project analyzes a survey of data professionals to uncover trends in salary, job satisfaction, demographics, and programming language preferences. As a data analyst, I cleaned the dataset, transformed it for analysis, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights. This documentation highlights my analytical skills in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, showcasing my ability to derive actionable insights from raw data.

# Dataset

The dataset, survey.xlsx, contains responses from 630 data professionals collected on June 10-26, 2022. It includes columns such as job title, salary, industry, favorite programming language, happiness metrics (e.g., salary, work/life balance), gender, age, country, and education level.

Exporting Cleaned Data: Saved the cleaned dataset as survey_cleaned.csv for use in Power BI.

The cleaning process ensured the data was accurate and ready for visualization.

# Dashboard Creation in Power BI

I created an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize key trends and insights from the cleaned dataset. The dashboard includes:



Avg Salary by Job Title: A bar chart comparing average salaries across roles like Data Scientist, Data Analyst, and Data Engineer.


Avg Salary with Male & Female: A donut chart showing gender distribution (50.1% Male, 49.9% Female) and average salary differences.


Count and Avg Age of Survey Takers: Summary cards displaying total respondents (630) and average age (29.87).


Country Live by Country Live: A treemap illustrating the geographic distribution of respondents, with the United States, India, and the United Kingdom as the top countries.


Happy with Salary and Work/Life Balance: Gauges showing average happiness scores (53.52 for salary, 4.27 for work/life balance out of 10).


Favorite Programming Language: A stacked bar chart detailing language preferences by job title, highlighting Python as the most popular choice.

The dashboard uses filters for interactivity, allowing users to explore data by country, job title, or gender.

# Key Insights


Salary Trends: Data Scientists have the highest average salary, followed by Data Architects, while Students/Looking/None have the lowest.


Gender Parity: The survey shows near-equal gender representation, with minimal salary disparity between males and females.


Geographic Distribution: The majority of respondents are from the United States (42%), followed by India (12%) and the United Kingdom (8%).


Job Satisfaction: Happiness with salary averages 53.52, but work/life balance scores lower at 4.27, indicating potential dissatisfaction in this area.


Programming Language Preference: Python is the most favored language (used by 60% of respondents), especially among Data Analysts and Data Scientists, followed by R and SQL.


Interesting Fact: Despite the tech industry being a top employer, respondents in healthcare report higher satisfaction with learning opportunities (average score of 7.8), suggesting a strong focus on professional development in that sector.

These insights demonstrate my ability to extract meaningful patterns and trends from complex datasets, a core skill for a data analyst.
